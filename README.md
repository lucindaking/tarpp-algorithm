# tarpp-algorithm

Lucinda King, 03 Feb 2021

This repository contains code pertaining to the development of the TARPP (Topographically Accurate Reflection Point Predictor) algorithm for GNSS reflectometry, which forms part of my PhD research at the University of Surrey with the collaboration of SSTL. 

The code includes scripts, for the algorithm itself and for analyses of it, and data such as Digital Elevation Models.
